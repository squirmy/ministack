"""
Regression tests for the persistence-symmetry architectural bug.

Background
----------
When PERSIST_STATE=1, every service that participates in `_state_map`
(see `ministack/app.py`) is saved on shutdown via `save_all()`. State is
restored on startup either by a service's own `load_state()` call at
module import time, OR by `_load_persisted_state()` which calls a
`load_persisted_state()` method on the service module.

For five services (autoscaling, backup, eks, scheduler, pipes), the
shutdown path persists the state to disk but no restore path runs at
startup, so the next boot starts with an empty store. `pipes` is
additionally missing from `_state_map`, so its state is never even saved.

These tests assert the round-trip works for every persisted service.

    """Generic regression for the NameError-at-import pattern that hit
    `ecs._attributes` (#492) and `acm._synthetic_pem` (#494).

    The bug shape: `restore_state(data)` references a module-level
    symbol declared further down the file. The import-time `try:
    load_state(...)` block calls `restore_state()` BEFORE Python
    evaluates the later definition, so the lookup NameErrors. The
    surrounding try/except logs `Failed to restore persisted state` and
    swallows the exception, so the module appears to import cleanly
    while ALL its persisted state silently disappears.

    The test:
      1. Captures the module's current `get_state()` snapshot (a
         non-empty dict-of-empty-dicts — important so `restore_state`
         doesn't early-return on truthy emptiness checks).
      2. Persists that to disk via the production `save_state` path.
      3. **Removes the module from `sys.modules` and re-imports it
         fresh** — `importlib.reload()` would NOT catch the bug
         because it merges new definitions into the existing
         namespace, leaving any late-declared symbol bound from the
         previous import.
      4. Asserts no WARNING+ log record mentioning "restore" / "failed"
         / "continuing fresh" was emitted during the cold import.

    Catches: unconditional symbol references in restore_state
    (ECS-style). Does NOT catch: conditional references inside loops
    over restored data when the data is empty (ACM-style needs
    populated state — see the per-service tests above).
